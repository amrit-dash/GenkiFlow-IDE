# **App Name**: GenkiFlow IDE

## Core Features:

- Multi-File Support: Support for multiple files and folder structures, enabling the AI agent to understand the entire codebase context.
- AI Code Assistant: An AI agent, powered by Genkit, which rewrites existing code, adds new code, and manipulates existing data, based on understanding the codebase, and incorporating reasoning to make appropriate edits via provided tool access.
- Interactive UI: User interface to interact with the AI agent, view suggestions, and apply changes.
- File System Tool: A tool allowing the AI agent to examine the file system.
- Codebase Search Tool: A tool allowing the AI agent to find relevant parts of the code base to inform responses and code edits.
- Edit File Tool: A tool allowing the AI agent to propose a code edit, with instructions for application.
- RAG Integration: Implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to effectively use the codebase as context for the AI agent.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Shades of Purple to reflect Material Design principles while maintaining a professional feel.
- Background color: Grey for a comfortable dark theme, reducing eye strain during long coding sessions.
- Text Color: Purple to highlight interactive elements and draw attention to important suggestions or actions.
- Body font: 'Century Gothic' sans-serif, for clean and modern readability. Headline Font: 'Century Gothic' sans-serif, for emphasis
- Material Design icons to provide a consistent and recognizable visual language throughout the IDE.
- Follow the blueprint layout, emphasizing clear separation of code editor, file explorer, and AI assistant panels for efficient workflow.
- Subtle animations (e.g., smooth transitions, progress indicators) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
